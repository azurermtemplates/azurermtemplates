This template allows you to deploy a Web application a VM. It also configures the Web Application to set the SQL Azure database server.

Pre-requisite for running the PowerShell script:
1. Set a current storage account for your Azure subscription. The DSC module will be created and uploaded to your current storage account 2. Upload your Web Deploy Package somewhere. In the example I have uploaded it to GitHub
